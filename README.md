An application I built using javascript and html canvas. Gravity falls in our universe as an inverse square due to the fact we live in three dimensions. (doubling the distance between two objects makes the force acting on them 4 times weaker). But what if it didn't? This application lets the user see what planetary orbits would be possible given different gravity distributions.
